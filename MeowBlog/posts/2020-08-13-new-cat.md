## 📝 Name and Origin

About my name Barren Cat. This name comes from the translation of my Chinese name. Barren happens to be similar to the social situation in my actual life, so I named it after barren. I hope I can meet more people and socialize more online Friends, also hope you can remember my Chinese name: 南荒喵

## 🎨 Character Creation

In terms of initial characteristics, beasts and cats are the main ones. The original intention is to be a cat lady, but who will maintain it? Well, I can only maintain it by myself. If I am a boy, then be a beast too? If I were shota, the sound would not match, so after a long time entangled in the internal heart, I decided to paint what I like. Later, I will play some games. The detailed character introduction will be described on the [character setting](/build.html) page. I don't need to elaborate here. I only record some creative thoughts here.

## 📋 Expected

It is planned that this character will be mainly active on platforms such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKvT-Fza3hnXM3m47lCCjPw) / [BiliBili](https://space.bilibili.com/32597774) , some dynamic notifications and the production of some new stickers will be posted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nhmiao) / [Telegram](https://t.me/nhnotice) , and illustrations will be released on [Pixiv](https://pixiv.net/users/55522166) . The discussion is currently conducted on community platforms such as [Telegram](https://t.me/nhfans) / [Discord](https://discord.gg/Yy82NY3) . The main content of the discussion is mainly character painting or those who like my role can participate in the exchange.
